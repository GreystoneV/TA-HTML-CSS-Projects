# TA-HTML-CSS-Projects
This is the repository for my Tech Academy HTML and CSS projects

## Projects
1. [Greystone Farms](https://github.com/GreystoneV/TA-HTML-CSS-Projects/tree/master/Project)
2. [Cinema](https://github.com/GreystoneV/TA-HTML-CSS-Projects/tree/master/bootstrap4_project)

### Greystone Farms Site
This needs a bit of adjustment. There was an error(user!) while working on it or commiting that led to issues.

### Cinema Site
This is a one page website for a movie theater. It contains a nav-bar, forms, cards, and dropdowns. It displays the movies that are showing, a description of them and their show times.
